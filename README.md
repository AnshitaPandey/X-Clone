This project is a web-based clone of the popular social media platform, Twitter (now known as X). Developed as a practical web development exercise, its primary goal is to replicate the core functionality and visual design of the original Twitter (X) website. This clone showcases proficiency in modern frontend development practices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For structuring the content and defining the web page layout.
* **JavaScript:** For implementing interactive features, dynamic content updates, and client-side logic.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapidly building custom designs and responsive layouts without leaving your HTML.

## Features (Common for a Twitter/X Clone)

While specific features might vary based on development progress, a typical Twitter (X) clone aims to include:

* **User Interface:** A visually similar layout to the original platform.
* **Tweet/Post Display:** Ability to view a feed of posts.
* **Basic Interaction:** Potentially features like liking posts.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

*(Note: If you have implemented more specific features like posting tweets, user profiles, authentication, etc., please add them here.)*

## Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AnshitaPandey/X-Clone.git](https://github.com/AnshitaPandey/X-Clone.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd X-Clone
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Since this is a frontend-only project, no server setup is required unless you plan to add backend functionality.

## Usage

Once you have opened the `index.html` file in your browser, you will see the replica of the Twitter (X) interface. You can interact with the elements as designed.

*(Add more specific usage instructions if your clone has interactive features beyond static display.)*
